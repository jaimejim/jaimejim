Other than technology, I've always liked reading philosophy. Normally I wouldn't write on this topic but it is pretty relevant as on May 11th there will be [the Internet Society (ISOC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society) Roundtable on the topic: ["A Brave New World: How does the Internet Affect Societies?"](https://www.internetsociety.org/25th/roundtable-may11).
As much as the title  of the Roundtable points to [Huxley's frightening dystopian novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World) and as much as [we are slowly getting there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia#Typical_dystopian_claims). I think the title is quite misleading. The Internet is working just fine, as *it was built to enable communication*. What is not working is the incentives around it, since *the Internet was not built to filter or curate the content* in any fashion. For that you have the services on top. Hence the problem often lies on which information is factually true and which one is not. My opinion is that some of the problems lie on the following:

**Wrong incentives.**
The advertising industry creates incentives for clickbait articles and centralizes much of the Internet's on few giants. Many websites increased their viewer share by using scandalous headings. News agencies copied the model to increase the number of viewers. Advertising is distorting the value of online services, from news, social networks to games or marketing.

**Decadence of journalism.**
As it happens, many newspapers these days, even reputable ones, don’t do investigative journalism anymore but rather copy-paste and translate from Thomson Reuter or from social media. Some news sources change title and content, or even delete their articles without publishing errata.

**Lack of scientific rigour on the news.**
Few news agencies use a scientific publication format, citing the original author or quoting them properly. I believe some don’t even link them in order not to lose future revenue from ad traffic. This presumably creates a bias on search engines (well, I mean Google again) and penalises the original source. Moreover, appealing to authority by citing a scientific paper sadly does not make the fact true.

**Risk of curation.**
To me, curating opinions is very dangerous, as it can be the stepping stone for censorship of ideas. The Internet should be the place where people can say or write whatever they want. When companies as powerful as Google and Facebook say they will “curate their results” I get a shiver.

**Bubble effect.**
Social networks, cookies, tracking tags, etc, all of that creates a feedback loop in which opinions polarise as content providers show you more of the kind of content you normally visit.

**Too much time on fantasy land**
In general people seem to spend just too many hours of the day online (myself included). It is probably unhealthy for adults but I believe this will be specially damaging for kids. They apparently spend 6 hours in front of a screen every day already http://archive.is/hObaL  

These are some of the problems I happened to think about, thinking about some possible paliative measures I believe they are mostly non-technical.

- Deny tampering of published information without showing a ["diff”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility). Some developer could build a very successful browser addon on this, showing a website and, if modified, showing a diff to multiple caches like archive.org, google cache, a public ledger. This way the reader could get some implicit of basic origin validation. However the problem would be how do you trust the validators? I guess it will boil down to reputation in some way.
- Enable logical debate, regardless of ideologies and without any form of curation. This is easier said than done, trolls would have a field day every day. News aggregators fail to do that as they link to the same potentially flawed sources. Some news-sites could try to build a knowledge base on formal logic, like [Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc) but for general knowledge. I believe there are similar systems built for the pharma, to discover incompatible medicines.
- Education on debate and logical thinking. Learning not to forward unverified articles.
- Terminate online advertising companies in order to terminate the wrong incentive system. This one would be really great :)
- Accept that truth will forever be relative, read [Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper#Philosophy_of_science) and go for a walk with a loved one.
- Above all... **spend less time online**.
