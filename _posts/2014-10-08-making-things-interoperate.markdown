## IPSO SO release

When the scale of connected devices grows, interoperability will be what makes the Internet of Things open and successful. 

Last week the [IP for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance](http://www.ipso-alliance.org/) released its Smart Objects [Starter Pack](http://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/)  the IPSO first draft on semantic Interoperability for the Internet of Things (IoT). This document, together with the existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) RFC and the OMA Lightweight M2M specification compose the backbone of what the future of IoT can be like.
