# Work in progress!!

## Summary:

As we mentioned on the [previous article](/making-things-interoperate/), IoT Standards for constrained devices are rapidly consolidating.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a reality, large numbers of very heterogeneous devices will have to be managed. How can this be done in the most efficient way?

This type of device management will expand, not only to automated software updates or error reporting of the devices, but also about how do they interact with their surroundings, with people and with other devices. That type of management will be based on the actual semantic properties of the devices. Moreover, features like energy consumption, processing power and network efficiency will be important than ever. In this context, the problem of how to manage different sensors on different locations at once becomes paramount; one single extra message per device can greatly increase network congestion.

As we wrote in our Evolved Capillary Networks blog, we initially focus on two key aspects; Distributed Cloud and now Group Management.
