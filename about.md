I am a researcher working on the area of Internet of Things. I have been doing a bit of everything related to IoT for several years, from scientific publications, standardization or design to prototyping and IPR. 

I live in Finland but I am originally from Madrid in Spain. I try to travel there as much as I can in winter cause it's freezing here. 

### IoT Standardization 

I have focused on REST-type of communications for sensors and I am actively contributing and helping to complete various standards. 

**Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**

I am currently co-chairing the [CoRE WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/charter/) which takes care of standardizing CoAP and CoAP related standards. The point of [CoAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) is to have a HTTP-like protocol for very resource constrained devices, thus connecting devices and the larger Internet.

**IP for Smart Objects (IPSO)**
I am also a key contributor and chair of the [IPSO Semantic Committeee](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/StartHere). Sorry that the github repository is private, so you can't see most of the content. It sounds very flamboyant but in reality we just do simple data models for those constrained devices I mentioned before. Sorry that the github repository is private, so you can't see most of the content. 

**Open Mobile Alliance - Lightweight Machine to Machine (OMA-LWM2M)**
Contributor and unofficial Ericsson contact (1 of the only 2 people participating from Ericsson)
Specification Reviewer

I also follow as much as I can the [Thing-to-Thing Research Group](https://github.com/t2trg), W3C's [WoT Interest Group](https://github.com/w3c/wot/) and the [Open Connectivity Foundationn](openconnectivity.org).
 
### Programming

* NodeJS, HTML, Jekyll (pretty basic)
* C (also very basic)
* Git, SVN
* Markdown (best thing that ever happened to me after my girlfriend)

### IPR

As a researcher I often stumble upon good ideas in our projects. Companies tend to do patents for those ideas that their products are based on. Thus I have done [quite a few patents](https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&q=ininventor:%22Jaime+JIMÃ‰NEZ%22+OR+%22Jaime+JIMENEZ%22) over the years.  I try to have a balance between the stuff I work on and IPR since I favor Open Source. I am aware that it can be contradictory too.
