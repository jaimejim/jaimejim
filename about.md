I am a researcher working on the area of Internet of Things. I have been doing a bit of everything related to IoT for several years, from scientific publications and standardization to design, prototyping and IPR.

I live in Finland but I am originally from Madrid in Spain. I try to travel there as much as I can in winter cause it's freezing here.

### IoT Standardization

I have focused on REST-type of communications for sensors and I am actively contributing and helping to complete various standards.

**Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**

I am currently co-chairing the [CoRE WG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/charter/) which takes care of standardizing CoAP and CoAP related standards. The point of [CoAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) is to have a HTTP-like protocol for very resource constrained devices, thus connecting devices and the larger Internet.

**IP for Smart Objects (IPSO)**

I am also a key contributor and chair of the [IPSO Semantic Committee](http://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub/). IPSO has been working on enabling IoT for about a decade already. Originally tasked with fostering the introduction of IPv6 it then produced data models to enable interoperable devices, agnostic of the application layer.

**Open Mobile Alliance - Lightweight Machine to Machine (OMA-LWM2M)**

[OMA-LWM2M](http://openmobilealliance.org) is another group to which I regularly contribute. LWM2M is a protocol based on CoAP, on top of which it builds a set of interfaces for managing devices.

I also follow as much as I can the [Thing-to-Thing Research Group](https://github.com/t2trg), W3C's [WoT Interest Group](https://github.com/w3c/wot/) and the [Open Connectivity Foundationn](openconnectivity.org).

### Programming

* NodeJS, HTML, Jekyll (pretty basic)
* C
* Git, SVN
* Markdown

### IPR

As a researcher I often stumble upon good ideas in our projects. Companies tend to do patents for those ideas that their products are based on. Thus I have done [quite a few patents](https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&q=ininventor:%22Jaime+JIMÃ‰NEZ%22+OR+%22Jaime+JIMENEZ%22) over the years.
