## Reflections

### Philosophy
* What I feel are "deep" thoughts, are probably experienced by most people. I'm not so special.

* Every time we sleep, we are losing consciousness and regaining it... unless you don't sleep well.

* People spend several hours of the day in front of a screen, out of the real world into a fantasy one.

* The average person does not have a perception of history. They seem to perceive in a haze how life was just a few decades ago, and that of a century as almost mythological. They live like on primitive times.

### Society and Politics

* In the middle ages people paid a "diezmo" which is 10% of your income (not necessarily currency at the time) to their land lords. Nowadays we pay at least 24% VAT...

* "My feeling is that either globalization halts in Europe in 2017 or Nation States do." 23 feb 2017

* The migratory phenomenon is essentially a way for animals to leave hostile environments into more favorable ones. It does not happen when conditions are right in the host environment. Modern society however seems to idealize this dysfunctional condition as a virtue or as an opportunity. From what I have seen, migration uproots and alienates individuals as well as fragments then homogeneous societies.

* More than 75% of my work could be done remotely. Yet I have to go to an office in the outskirts to create an artificial appearance of community of with other colleagues in the same situation.

* British anglo-saxon culture has been completely swallowed by the US mass-marketed pop culture in the last 30-40 years.

* At some point in 2015-2016 the left became the establishment and the right became the anti-establishment in the West.  

* "Diversity" (people immigration) is encouraged only in Western societies. Asia has no such phenomenon, or at the very least not so enforced.

### Technology

* Internet companies have dedicated billions to create HTTP2 to improve the web browsing experience. Being porn sites and "social" websites the most visited this means that millions of man-hours of the most brilliant minds have been dedicated to shave of half a second load time of facebook, pornhub or 9gag.

* RFCs are good for developers implementing a protocol. O'Reilly books and the like are good for understanding how they work as they provide the valuable context.

* Every HTTP2 Connection preface contains the text "PRI", sarcastically honoring PRISM.

### Personal

* "I think that globalization and multiculturalist policies are two arms of the same target. One has to do with military and economic might and the other with society and ethnic demographics. I think it's effects are not well thought and that we will see it fail." Sep-2016

* Every time that I discuss identity or immigration as an European I have gotten called fascist and the conversation has stopped.

* I have spent most of my days longing for something, the past being imbued of melancholy and the future of uncertainty.

* I have trouble accepting that I am of no significance to many people that have known me. Even worse, to people that were significant to me.

* For the past 12 years I have spent about 9 hours a day in front of some screen.
