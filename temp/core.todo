IETF - CoRE Working Group 
-------------------------

CoRE WG General:
 ☐ Github right now has all users, we will move slowly towards a pull request. All authors should have commit access and everyone else (including authors) send pull request. Current set up. New stuff goes to the Github repository, old stuff goes in the IETF issue tracker. So far TCP/TLS, ETCH and CBOR-YANG are there, SenML to go there too. 
 ☐ Split this document as two: progress report and internal items. Add "@ext" tag to the stuff we wanna share, remove "@due" tag from those, unless it is a milestone, optionally just write a tentative date. Remove the done tasks. @high
 ☐ Check RFC formatting and send feedback on the line spacing for https://core-wg.github.io/etch/ and check more on http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt/rfc2629xslt.html
