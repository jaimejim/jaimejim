CoRE WG General:
 ☐ Github right now has all users as POs, we will move slowly towards a pull request. 
 ☐ Current set up. New stuff goes to the Github repository, old stuff goes in the IETF issue tracker.
 
TCP TLS draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls:
 ☐ We need to discuss whether the signalling messages can be push to a different document. Discussion on Mailing list @Carsten
 ☐ Brian Raymor to become editor TCP/TLS Document. Possibly yes. We have to think about further instructions for him. 
      Problems: Technical content, multiple proposals. 
      Needed ideas? Actual Requirements?
      Settings negotiation?
      Basic diagnostics
 Interested parties: Brian, Hannes, Simon, Carsten, Klaus. 
      CoAP over TCP (Class 2) (NAT traversal)
      CoAP draft about signaling messages to rise these items. 
      Klaus 

ETCH draft-ietf-core-etch:
 ☐ FETCH = HTTP SEARCH
 ☐ Examples to be sent by Peter/Carsten
 ☐ ETCH First cover issues, then ask for new version (2 weeks). Then ask for feedback on mailing list (2 weeks). If there are no objections then WGLC (2 weeks) @Jaime @due(16-05-30 13:42)
 ☐ ETCH target IESG submission @due(16-07-25 15:25)
 
HTTP draft-ietf-core-http-mapping:
 ☐ HTTP mapping Finished, no issues left. Read and send to second WGLC (2 weeks). @Jaime @due(16-06-11 21:30) @critical
 ☐ HTTP mapping IESG submission @due(16-07-15 15:31)
     WGLC takes a couple of weeks, authors need a couple of weeks for changes. Thus WGLC 1 month before (1st week of June). The assumption is that we will find a couple of nits that need to be done by the authors. 

CoRE Links draft-ietf-core-links-json:
 ☐ Core Links has still some Issues, Draft with no issues to be submitted @due(16-06-27 15:36)
     #402  A reference implementation for links-json would be useful. | @Carsten
     #403  Should the RFC 7390 part of links-json be split off? | YES. 
     #404  The group-format representations in CBOR use textual representations of IP addresses and port numbers | 
 ☐ Core Link tentative WGLC @due(16-07-18 15:36)
 ☐ Jaime to send JSON Objects of LWM2M to Carsten @Jaime

RD draft-ietf-core-resource-directory:
 ☐ Read diffs provided by Oscar: https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-07.txt&url2=http://users.piuha.net/eoscdia/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-08.txt  @Carsten @Peter
 ☐ Should RD include additional functionality for W3C-TD? @due(16-06-11 20:57)
 ☐ New version to be submitted @due(16-06-14 20:58)
 ☐ WGLC @due(16-08-01 15:28), depending on W3C-TD dependency
 ☐ Shepherd: WGLC, IETF process. Oscar to be shepherd after Carsten reads and comments. 

SenML draft-ietf-core-senml:
 ☐ Ari to send updates, change editorial items. @due(16-06-16 23:52)
 ☐ Issue 407. Waiting for reply from authors. Say that we want to have the result at noon next Monday. Is this document ready for WGLC (no tickets)
 ☐ SenML draft-ietf-core-senml IESG @due(16-08-01 15:28)
