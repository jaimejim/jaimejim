## WG Items

ðŸ”” **Representing CoRE Link Format in JSON and CBOR**

[draft-ietf-core-links-json](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-links-json-09) was not discussed at the  meeting. Some good input was provided by OCF at the 2017-11-10 [OCF/T2TRG](https://github.com/t2trg/2017-11-ocf) meeting, which will now enable these changes to be made. Soon to be RFC.

ðŸ”” **CoAP over TCP**

[draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls/) is soon to be RFC, we are waiting for AD's DISCUSS to clear.  The first interop on Saturday had 2.5 implementations (libcoap, augustcellars and coap.me). Interop on Tue 12th Dec.

## WG Items

ðŸ”” **Congestion Control for CoAP**

[draft-ietf-core-cocoa](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-cocoa/) . Improves CoAP Congestion Control and provides guidelines for retransmission timeouts and non-confirmable messages. It also provides a new RTO estimation mechanism based on RFC6298. WGLC ends 14th Dec.

**Resource Directory**

[draft-ietf-core-resource-directory](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory/) quite a lot of progress in the last few months. Developers should start updating their implementations as interop would be call on Q1-Q2 2018. Work over multiple transports and new schemes still to be done. The increased work needs to transfer to sister document draft-ietf-core-rd-dns-sd now. WGLC by IETF101.

```c
    Req: GET coap://[ff02::1]/.well-known/core?rt=core.rd*
    Res: 2.05 Content
    </rd>;rt="core.rd";ct=40,
    </rd-lookup/ep>;rt="core.rd-lookup-ep";ct=40,
    </rd-lookup/res>;rt="core.rd-lookup-res";ct=40,
    </rd-lookup/gp>;rt="core.rd-lookup-gp";ct=40,
    </rd-group>;rt="core.rd-group";ct=40
```

???
The following example shows an endpoint discovering an RD using this
interface, thus learning that the directory resource is, in this
example, at /rd, and that the content-format delivered by the server
hosting the resource is application/link-format (ct=40).  Note that
it is up to the RD to choose its RD resource paths.

## WG Items
**CBOR Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG**

[draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor/) stable, but not enough interop testing to enable a WGLC. Initial testing happened during the IETF100 hackathon. Interop is intended for IETF 101, after which WGLC will be issued.

**CoAP Management Interface**

[draft-ietf-core-comi](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-comi/) There was some discussion about cutting the plethora of request types in basic COMI down to just FETCH and PATCH (possibly with GET added), to be continued on the list. Tools to visualize SIDs
would be necessary. The proposed SID registry is now online for the initial reviewers Available at <https://comi.space/>

ðŸ”” **Media Types for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)**

[draft-ietf-core-senml](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-senml/) finished WGLC and needs some remaining minor updates, to be submitted to IESG in December.

## WG Items


ðŸ”” **Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)**

[draft-ietf-core-object-security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-object-security/) enables application-layer protection of CoAP messages. Provides end-to-end encryption, integrity and replay protection, as well as a secure message binding.  Can be used wherever CoAP can be used, and also with HTTP. Technical cooperation agreement in place with RISE in order to add OSCORE to Wakaama and Leshan. WGLC ends in December.

**Publish-Subscribe Broker for CoAP**

[draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub/) is a bit behind schedule. Good recent feedback from ARM.

**Dynamic Resource Linking for Constrained RESTful Environments**

[draft-ietf-core-dynlink](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-dynlink/)  and draft-ietf-core-interfaces have been in
limbo for a while.  With a new editor, the remaining editorial issues can be fixed.

---

## New Items

**Secure group communication for CoAP** - Adopted!

[draft-tiloca-core-multicast-oscoap](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tiloca-core-multicast-oscoap/) explains how to do OSCORE for group communication. It is very useful in environments that support multicast.

**YANG Push Operations for CoMI**

[draft-birkholz-yang-push-coap-problemstatement](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-birkholz-yang-push-coap-problemstatement-00) deals with how YANG Push can be used with CoAP. Future work on how this relates to COMI and CoAP Observe.

**HTTP-Payments**

[draft-hope-bailie-http-payments](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hope-bailie-http-payments-00) was presented as a heads-up; several participants stressed the relationship of the subject matter to ACE work.

## Other Items

**CoAP over SMS**

[draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-becker-core-coap-sms-gprs-06) hadn't reached the threshold for WG adoption earlier; there is some renewed interest. Coordination with LWM2M work will be needed.

**Uniform Resource Names for Device Identifiers** - Adopted!

[draft-arkko-core-dev-urn](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-arkko-core-dev-urn/) presents a new URN namespace for HW device identifiers (i.e. `urn:dev:mac:0024befffe804ff1`)

**OPC UA Message Transmission Method over CoAP**

[draft-wang-core-opcua-transmission](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wang-core-opcua-transmission/) was presented as a way to map OPC/UA on CoAP.  Discussion touched the issue whether OPC should be doing this or the IETF.  In any case, the authors were encouraged to continue the work, talk to OPC as well and keep IETF involved.

<!--
## Conclusions

* Depending on their backlog onboard AppIoT on:
  * OSCORE: Target to add OSCORE to master branch of Leshan and Wakaama in collaboration with RISE. Competitive advantage through security and group security.
  * CoAP+SMS: Work in progress to onboard AppIoT, we have to be careful with the prioritization as they are overloaded.
  * Resource Directory: Existing implementations will have to be updated, opportunity for Ericsson to shine within Leshan community. Possible to onboard other OMA folks (Wojek, David, Hannes, Mohammed, ...) on this.
  * Resource Directory implementation needs to be updated.

* OCF-T2TRG meeting right before IETF.
  * CoAP protocol negotiation. Increased complexity but possible benefits.
  * CoAP link format additions.
