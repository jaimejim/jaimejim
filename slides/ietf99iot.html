#IETF99 and IoT

* **WISHI Workshop**
  * <https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi/tree/master/slides>
  * In general similar presentations as [IoTSI](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/iotsi/), some progress done during the year.
  * Novel presentation about [iot.schema.org](https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi/blob/master/slides/04-iotschema-wishi-15072017.pdf), we have been involved in the drafting.
  * Interesting presentation about [WoT](https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi/blob/master/slides/05-WoT-wishi-2017.pdf), tries to be the "glue in-between" aplication and platform silos.
  * Cool practical example [HyCoWare](https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi/blob/master/slides/21-Challenges-for-Semantic-LWM2M-Interoperability-in-Complex-IoT-Systems_WI....pdf)
  * Other SDOs (OCF, Fairhair, OMA, IPSO ...) also represented.

*Hard to take away something very concrete. Most SDOs are cryptic about their deployments.*

* [Yang of Things (YoT)](https://github.com/Ixau/yot/blob/master/ietf99/AggregatedSlides-Main.pdf).
  * Interesting for heavy on YANG companies.
  * One single registry of SIDs to rule them all.

    * ☺ Novel, bold and concrete use of YANG for application data.

    * ☹ Like all other models, it needs broader support to work. Managing the SID registry might be unrealistic. Different angles (YANG people worry about development costs, IoT worry about RAM), technical challenges (version control, )

* **CoRE WG**

* Interops were arranged for Object Security over CoAP.
  * Code available <https://core-wg.github.io/oscoap/>.
  * Interop results <https://ericssonresearch.github.io/OSCOAP/>


* DNS-SD in Resource Directory. Not used in LWM2M but could be a useful addition. The whole issue of **finding the RD** on the first place and normalizing discovery was brought up multiple times.<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory>

  * LWM2M has a harcoded RD URI (LWM2M Server).
  * Multicast and reusing DHCP response is also possible.
  * DNS-SD part defines few attributes to describe resources in an RD to allow for internetworking with DNS service. No open implementation AFAIK.
  * OCF is looking into RD discovery over Wifi.

* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/core-coap-sms-gprs> should have more people from the operator side interested. Surprising (to me) the little participation, knowing that it is suposed to be used on LWM2M.

---

* As seen with YoT, it seems to quietly be progressing too but the outcome is uncertain. In particular it could be useful for really constrained environents like LoRA, NB-IoT or SigFox. They already have figured out a way to do compression so that they can fit a CoAP message in less than 20 bytes (!).
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor>
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-sid>

* OSCoAP seems to be becoming quite popular as an alternative to TLS/DTLS. Other usages popping up in other WGs. Usage for PubSub specified. Main guys are from Ericsson (Göran Selander and Francesca Palombini).<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-object-security>

* As far as authorization mechanisms go, we all should increase our competence on OAuthz <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-06>

---

* Relatively big issue found with **CoAP over TCP** and specially with URIs in CoAP. LWM2M and OCF will use CoAP over TCP and update their specifications accordingly but we will have to revert back to version since the current solution is unworkable with the mapping of coap to multiple transports (coap+tcp, coaps+tcp, coap+ws, coaps+ws). Discussion an alternatives are available at draft-thaler-appsawg-multi-transport-uris-01 . New "all transports" **coap+at://** URI scheme has been added and details are being worked on. Target is to have one URI scheme that maps to multiple transports.

* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs> under the radar to some, it's an excellent document narrating use cases and security requirements for working with CoAP in proxied networks.

### Personal Takeaways

* Registries moving into linear space ala SID. <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-sid>
* CoAP Pub-Sub Profile for ACE. <https://mail.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palombini-ace-coap-pubsub-profile-00>
* Read and understand <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-06>
* Discovery, process and steps. Find Daves Thaler audio from T2TRG. <http://etherpad.tools.ietf.org:9000/p/notes-ietf-98-t2trg?useMonospaceFont=true>
* Use of DNS-SD in RD, follow up on the new doc. <https://github.com/core-wg/rd-dns-sd>  read <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763#page-30> too
* VRF Only the holder of the private VRF key can compute the hash, but anyone with corresponding public key can verify the correctness of the hash. <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-goldbe-vrf-00> <https://github.com/fcelda/nsec5-crypto>
