# CoRE WG  - Summary IETF96


# Tuesday 2016-07-19

* draft-ietf-core-block-21.txt is in the RFC editor queue.

* draft-ietf-core-etch–01: WGLC is completed, issues discussed. To be
 determined: 4.12 vs. 4.09.  When that is settled, updated version to
 be submitted to IESG.

* draft-ietf-core-links-json–06 is in the middle of WGLC (till
 2016-07-30) and was briefly discussed.  There are some claims in the
 document that it considers a larger world of JSON-LD etc.; the
 intention however is to be a simple RFC 6690 mapping and those
 claims will be cut down.

* draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls–03: The merge of TCP/TLS, Websockets,
 Signaling, and BERT was completed in this version.  Several issues
 discussed.  In particular, there was in-room consensus to follow the
 lead of RFC 7252 and make the use of TLS mandatory to implement.

* with the larger number of transport schemes now available,
 draft-silverajan-core-coap-protocol-negotiation-03 was discussed.
 There is good interest in this ongoing work, some of which is also
 related to other ongoing work in T2TRG.

* draft-ietf-core-resource-directory–08 is nearing WGLC; reviewers
 have been identified.

* Brief introductions were made for
 draft-gomez-core-tcp-constrained-node-networks–00,
 draft-groves-coap-webrtcdc–00,
 draft-zheng-core-coap-lantency-evaluation–00.

* For draft-bormann-core-cocoa-04, there was in-room consensus for
 working-group adoption; to be confirmed on the list.

# Thursday 2016-07-21

* draft-ietf-core-http-mapping-13 took some minor fixes and has been
 submitted to IESG on 2016-07-22.

* For the core-interfaces draft, the split was confirmed into
 draft-ietf-core-interfaces–05 and draft-groves-core-dynlink–00 (plus
 some material that was removed and maybe can be picked up by T2TRG);
 as not enough people had read the split-off draft-groves, we will
 take the otherwise obvious adoption to the list.

* draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor–02: target is to do some additional
 validation with the NetMod experts and check again by end of
 September. There are a couple of implementations ongoing.

* draft-somaraju-core-sid–01. One suggestion wsas to use a OID
 subtree. Too few people had read the newest version for room
 consensus on working-group adoption, but noone against; to be taken
 to the list.

* draft-veillette-core-cool & draft-vanderstok-comi: around 6 people
 read the draft, agreement on splitting out the more advanced
 features so a basic specification can be completed by the end of the
 year. Work ongoing on mapping YANG and LWM2M/IPSO objects. Some
 concerns about the diagnostic value of SIDs in debugging and
 possible problems with YANG "choice", work needs to continue.

* draft-hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs–01: good rewrite; further
 requirements are being identified, discussion to be taken to the
 mailing list.

* draft-selander-ace-object-security–05: room consensus to adopt as WG
 item, to be confirmed on the mailing list.

* draft-ietf-core-senml–02: good ongoing discussion that should be
 completed on the mailing list.

* draft-koster-core-coap-pubsub–05: brokerless pubsub has been added.
 Take adoption to mailing list but clear room consensus already (~10
 people), reviewers identified.
