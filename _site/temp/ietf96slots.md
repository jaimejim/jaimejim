##Slot Requests for IETF96

**draft-hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs**

* Abstract: This document analyses threats to CoAP message exchanges traversing
   proxies and derives the security requirements for mitigating those
   threats.
* Objective: Find reviewers.
* Time: 10 mins.

**draft-urien-core-identity-module-coap**

* Abstract: This document defines identity modules based on Secure Elements processing DTLS/TLS stacks for CoAP devices.
* Objective: starting a working item for open identity modules. Tamper resistant guaranties should be a prerequisite for a network of trillion objects.
* Time: 10 mins.

**draft-silverajan-core-coap-protocol-negotiation**

* Abstract: When multiple transports exist for exchanging CoAP resource representations, this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints to agree upon alternate transport and protocol configurations as well as URIs.
* Objective: Present alternatives, obtain WG consensus and reviewers.
* Time: 10 mins.


###CoOL/CoMI related work

**Roadmap**

* Abstract: Document roadmap.
* Objective: what to expect, when to expect it, and why.
* Time: 5 mins.

**draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor**

* Abstract:  This document defines encoding rules for serializing configuration data, state data, RPC input and RPC output, Action input, Action output and notifications defined within YANG modules using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).
* Objective: What to expect, when to expect it, and why.
* Time: 10-15 mins.

**draft-somaraju-core-sid**

* Abstract: Structured IDentifiers (SID) are used to identify different YANG items when encoded in CBOR. This document defines the registration and assignment processes of SIDs. To enable the implementation of these processes, this document also defines a file format used to persist and publish assigned SIDs.
* Objective: Concept, use and call for adoption of the WG.
* Time: 10 min.

**draft-veillette-core-cool**

* Abstract: This document describes a management function set adapted to constrained devices and constrained networks (e.g., low-power, lossy).  CoOL objects (datastores, RPCs, actions and notifications) are defined using the YANG modelling language. 
* Objective: Explaining basic operation set, open questions of interest.
* Time: 10 min.
