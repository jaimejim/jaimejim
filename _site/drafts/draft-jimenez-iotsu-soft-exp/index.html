<p>— abstract
This document provides a summary of found problems and possible solutions for software upgrades on the constrained space. Some of the issues are still open and should be subject of discussion. Ideally some implementation guidelines should be made when using CoAP , HTTP  or MQTT as transfer protocols. The sections are purposedly left short as they are open issues that should be discussed.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<p>We start with the assumption of a device that is constrained but does not require gateways for communication as it uses some operator-based connectivity (though we do not assume SMS transport).</p>

<p>This simple, generic set up presents several problems, specially when dealing with the operator environment. We enumerate some of them below.</p>

<h1 id="sleepy">Dealing with Sleepy endpoints</h1>

<p>The fact that devices are sleepy poses several problems for doing software updates. Namely that you do not have a connected endpoint most of the time and that therefore the device will have to contact the manager or the manager will have to poll the device pretty frequently. The case for polling does not scale and therefore it is hardly a solution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is very common to use polling on the constrained space since the server has more capabilities and thus can query the device providing that there are no NATs or firewalls (See )</p>

<h1 id="devini">Device Initiated Communication</h1>

<p>The first issue are NATs and Firewalls. Constrained devices do not have the capabilities nor the inclination to punch holes through NATs and keep them open, that task has to be delegated elsewhere.</p>

<p>What we have done in order to overcome this obstacle is to set an observation on the device. Assuming that the device has previously registered on a Resource Directory (RD)  that the manager has access to, the manager would then observe the status of the device (0:off, 1:on). Whenever the device wakes up it will send a notification to the manager. During the time the NAT is open the manager will be able to send data through the holes in the NAT.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>D&lt;--M: CoAP GET /Radio_link_status, Token: 0x4a, Observe: 0  
D--&gt;M: 2.05 Content, Token: 0x4a, payload: 1, time: 1464619477
D--&gt;M: 2.05 Content, Token: 0x4a, payload: 1, time: 1464520998
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="serverini">Manager Initiated Communication</h1>
<p>NATs and Firewalls are persistent issues to resolve also in manager initiated communication. However, we could re-use the capabilities of CoAP to overcome this issue.</p>

<p>In this approach, there is no need to set a separate observation on the status of the device as defined in . When the device sends a notification to any existing observation on any resource, the manager can initiate the software update during the established connection through NAT. This approach requires the manager to implement the logic of linking observation of any resource to send software update to the device.</p>

<h1 id="delegation">Delegation on other nodes</h1>

<p>Many of the IoT devices may not have connectivity to the manager and gateways are used to provide such connectivity to the manager in the e.g. core network. Gateways used in this use case are more capable to perform complex operations and to support different protocol stacks together, which can be used to update the device software.</p>

<p>For our implementation we assumed that the gateway supports, at least, both CoAP and HTTP stacks. The communication between the device and the gateway is performed using CoAP. Gateway can retrieve the software update from the manager through HTTP without NAT issues and cache the downloaded package. One other way for the gateway to retrieve the software package could be to observe software update resource on the manager via CoAP observe option. The manager notifies the gateway with CoAP notifcation when there is a software update available. When the device wakes up and connects to the gateway, the gateway can push the cached software update to the device.</p>

<p>However, this approach requires the Gateway to have the required credentials to perform such software update operation. This can be achieved e.g. by having a CoAP proxy on the Gateway.</p>

<p>Gateway retrieving software package via HTTP:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>G--&gt;M: HTTP GET /swupdate  
G&lt;--M: 200 Content, payload: swpackage
D&lt;--G: COAP POST /sw, Token: 0xbb, payload: swpackage
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Gateway retrieving software package via CoAP Observe option:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>G--&gt;M: COAP GET /swupdate, Token: 0x6a, Observe: 0  
G&lt;--M: 2.05 Content, Token: 0x6a, payload: swpackage
D&lt;--G: COAP POST /sw, Token: 0xbb, payload: swpackage
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="many">Using Multiple Stacks</h1>

<p>We have seen how in some cases devices have multiple stack combinations and updates go through an “alternative channel”. For example:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>MQTT+HTTP</dt>
  <dd>in this scenario MQTT is used as the base protocol for communication. Having publish/subscribe architecture simplifies the (1:n) and (n:1) communication use cases that are very common for reporting sensor data. For firmware upgrades a command is sent to the device with the URL where the new binaries are (i.e. https://company/devicetype/version00.zip), the device then sets a whole different communication channel just for that, as well as a dedicated DTLS/TLS connection. This is too much overhead for many constrained devices.</dd>
  <dt>MQTT+CoAP</dt>
  <dd>similar to previous scenario, MQTT is the base protocol for communication and firmware upgrade command is sent to the device in an MQTT message, which includes the CoAP URL to the binary to be downloaded. The device opens a UDP connection to the CoAP endpoint and downloads the binary with e.g. CoAP blockwise transfer. This scenario may occur when the node serving the software package supports only CoAP.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="run">Runtime Discovery</h1>

<p>Instead of sending bulk binaries with several megabytes of data, a simpler approach would be to send partial modifications related to the software update when possible.</p>

<p>Similarly as it was shown in the IOTSI Workshop , Runtime Discovery is also a very powerful mechanism to provide updated services and software to a device.</p>

<p>A device could use a single entry point for its firmware information (e.g. “/fw”), then device would periodically perform discovery on that point and in order to discover new capabilities. Links to the new capabilities could be discoverable on demand. Only very basic semantics would be shared a-priori.</p>

<p>Current software upgrade mechanism do not allow for changes at runtime. There are predefined interfaces that would break whenever the API changes, making it compulsory to send new software to the device that would need to install it, reboot, etc. The device logic has to support such interfaces, no changes are possible at runtime.</p>
