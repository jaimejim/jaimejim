             CoAP functionality expected in an LWM2M system
                 draft-jimenez-coap-functionality-lwm2m

Abstract

   This document provides a strawman summary of found problems and
   possible recommendations for the LWM2M specification [LWM2M].  LWM2M
   is based on CoAP, on top of which it describes certain management
   interfaces and data models that go beyond the CoAP specifications
   itself.  However LWM2M does not properly describe all behavior that
   should be expected from implementations of the CoAP specifications.
   This document attempts to clarify what should be present in a LWM2M
   system beyond what is specified in the LWM2M documents.
   Additionally, this document also adds information about IPSO Objects
   [IPSO] and their usage with LWM2M as application protocol.

1.  Introduction

   The current LWM2M protocol is probably the main Device Management
   protocol

2.  Terminology

   The LWM2M Specification tends to use its own terminology for client,
   server, etc.  When possible it would be better to _use the existing
   terminology on to avoid confusion_[RFC7252].

   For example the use of LWM2M "Client" and "Server" and the roles they
   play has confused developers that are initiating on the protocol.

   Similarly, the reference to existing drafts of RFCs often can mislead
   the reader to believe that the full RFC has been implemented. _If
   there is only partial support to a CoRE WG document, then it would be
   better to state it so_.

   For example the Registration interface in LWM2M can mislead readers
   to believe that CoAP Resource Directory is implemented, while in
   reality it is not.

3.  Interaction Model

   LWM2M has been created with a strong focus on centralizing control
   and management.  Devices set associations with their manager and all
   traffic is directed to the cloud.  All this is fine but in the

   process some functionalities that could be used locally device to
   device and device to application have been ignored.

   Below we have common configurations that make use of LWM2M.

   o  (1) Manager and Client Endpoint configuration.

   o  (2) Device to Device configuration.

   o  (3) Device to Application configuration.

3.1.  1.  Manager and Client Endpoint configuration.

   This is the common LWM2M compliant implementation we have today.
   However there are upcoming RFCs and drafts that greatly enhance LWM2M
   with more CoAP features.

   For example TCP support is soon going to be added to CoAP.  The draft
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls] outlines the changes required to use
   CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports.

   Support for features like PATCH/FETCH [I-D.ietf-core-etch] could be
   greatly beneficial for things like firmware upgrade or observing
   _relatively_ large sets of resources.

3.2.  2.  Device to Device configuration.

   This configuration contemplates that devices will sometimes talk to
   each other.  Specially in cases when all devices are under the same
   subnet, this could be pretty common.  For example devices could be
   more resilient if they did not have to contact their manager
   constantly, in case of lack of internet connectivity the local IoT

   network would still function.  Managers could just set policies on
   the devices and they would operate more autonomously.

   For this setup to take place, LWM2M would be used more the way CoAP
   is intended to be used.  A Resource Directory implementation
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] would be needed, either on the
   LWM2M server in addition to the registration interface or standalone.
   Devices should be able to perform lookup on that RD and get the
   series of links to resources elsewhere.  They should be able to find
   new functionality through /.well-known/core.  If not, at least they
   should be able to use IP multicast as expressed on [RFC7390]

   Needless to say, it is assumed that devices would be running a CoAP
   Server on them and would support CoAP Observe [RFC7641], so that
   devices can subscribe to updates form one another, thus becoming more
   autonomous.

   The current LWM2M Data Model is not expressive enough when it comes
   to data types, that should be changed too.  More on that in
   Section 4.  Also Web Linking will be dealt at Section 5.

3.3.  3.  Device to Application configuration.

   In some other cases you might have applications running on the phone
   connecting locally to sensors and/or control actuators.  A smartphone
   can access directly a CoAP home sensor using a mutually authenticated
   'https' request, provided its home router runs a HC proxy and is
   configured with the appropriate certificate.  For this scenario to
   happen, the GW should implement a HTTP-COAP proxy.  It is highly
   recommended then that they make use of [I-D.ietf-core-http-mapping]
   to properly do the URI mapping and specific ABNF queries.

   Just like other devices, smartphone applications should be able to
   discover devices using standard methods.

4.  Data Model

   The LWM2M Model is specified in [LWM2M].  Other models that build on
   it like IPSOs or OneM2M have spawn out of it.  They normally
   introduce incremental features.  They usually allow for performing
   any set of operations on a device through a CoAP interface.
   Resources are exposed as Objects using the same data model used for
   management.

   For example, in the case of a temperature sensor we can access and
   subscribe to the readings of the device (using [IPSO]).

   Res: 2.05 Content (25 C)
   Res (Notify): 2.05 Content (26 C)

   There has also been much work on different serialization and
   compression mechanisms that LWM2M could consider adopting.  A
   serialized JSON file like the one below could be greatly compressed
   (about 46% max, depending on the case) using CBOR notation
   [I-D.ietf-core-links-json] instead.

   {      "e": [{
           bn: "/3303/0",
           e: [{
               "n": "5700",
               "v": 20.0 }, {
               "n": "5701",
               "v": "c" }, {
               "n": "5603",
               "v": 10 }, {
               "n": "5604",
               "v": 40
           }],    }, {
           bn: "/3302/0",
           e: [{
               "n": "5500",
               "v": true }, {
               "n": "5501",
               "v": 23
   }       ]}]}

   LWM2M ResourceIDs do not mean anything semantically.  This is
   frustrating for those who preferred IDs that are uniquely identified,
   just like the Objects are.  Adding a similar registry for IDs would
   be useful.  Specially to those using it for their applications based
   in IPSO Objects.

5.  Web Linking

   One thing that pretty much _everyone_ is expecting is some form of
   Web Link resource type.  ObjectLinks are not sufficient.  There has
   been much work on web linking on [RFC6690] that has not been used in
   the LWM2M spec.  At the very least a new Data Type named "Web Link"
   should be added.  Instead of the simple ObjectID:InstanceID that is
   expressed now, a proper WebLink would be used.  That would take full
   advantage of other features like [I-D.ietf-core-links-json] or even
   newer Object Models.

   Other use cases contemplate some form of Object Redirection to help
   decouple management and applications.  LWM2M expects that the
   management servers will observe resources and collect telemetry on
   the management server itself.  If LWM2M is to be used as application
   protocol as well as management, it should provide a way for
   applications or CoAP Clients to observe resources on the devices,
   together with their required credentials.  Such credentials should be
   stored on the device in some way, maybe a new Object.

6.  Collaboration

   It would also be advisable to further collaboration between
   organizations developing CoAP-based standard implementations.  At the
   moment there is little inter group communication nor discussion.
   That should change.

   The IETF CoRE WG has quite some people also interested on device
   management.  Communication would be mutually beneficial.  Example of
   that work is on COMI [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] or data model
   translation.

   OMA LWM2M could also benefit from workshops that gather most of the
   industry, such as [IOTSI] and [IOTSU].
